# Project Description

**ByteBooks** is a Java-based Library Management System designed for small libraries, classrooms, or anyone learning object-oriented programming. It provides a command interface for:

- Viewing all books
- Checking out and returning books
- Tracking availability
- Sorting books by title using a recursive merge sort
- Reading book data from an external file

---

# Key Concepts Used
- **OOP:** Custom classes ('Book', 'Member', 'LibrarySystem')
- **Recursions & Algorithms:** Merge sort for book titles
- **Data Structures:** ArrayList, Scanner
- **File I/O:** Load book data from 'books.txt' file

---

# Files Included
- 'Main.java' - Starting point for the program
- 'LibrarySystem.java' - Core menu and logic
- 'Book.java' - Book object with title, author, ISBN, and availability
- 'Member.java' - Member object with name and ID
- 'SortHelper.java' - Recursive sorting logic
- 'books.txt' - External file filled with book data
